Trump Paints Himself Into A Corner in Oval Office

Donald J. Trump, fresh from a second contentious Oval Office meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, wasted no time blaming both Democrats for the breakdown in negotiations designed to bring an end to the federal government’s shutdown, now entering its third week.

“Donald Trump’s done the impossible,” said Capitol Hill pundit Althea Thoone. “He’s painted himself into a corner in a room that has no corners – the Oval Office!”

Sen. Chuck Schumer called the President’s latest behavior a temper tantrum. “Unfortunately, the president just got up and walked out,” Schumer told a throng of waiting reporters. Trump reportedly threw papers on the floor and stormed away after Speaker Pelosi again denied Trump funding for his border wall.

The shutdown has been a particularly sticky wicket for the president, particularly after the trio’s first meeting, when Trump, seated beside a stoic Vice President Pence, told the two Democratic leaders that he would take the blame for the shutdown.

“He’s painted a picture of himself as this border security warrior,” said Thoone, “but he’s bristled during recent meetings with Pelosi and Schumer because of his refusal to back down on his principal campaign promise — to build the wall.”
